## Programming a Real Self-Driving Car
The goal of the project is to program a car that can drive autonomosly, and detect and obey traffic lights, in a constrained real-world environment (parking lot). The underlying platform is ROS and all of the core functionality of the autonomous vehicle system is implemented as ROS nodes. The code is first tested on a simulator by driving around on a fixed track with traffic lights. Once the vehicle drives successfully in the simulator, the code can be loaded on Udacity's self-driving test vehicle, Carla, and tested in the parking lot.

In the following sections we give a brief system architecture overview and describe the system components we've implemented.

### System Architecture
The following system architecture diagram shows a good high-level overview of the system components involved and how they interact with each other.

### Planning
#### Waypoint Loader Node
The Waypoint Loader Node reads in a set of waypoints on the map and creates a vector of waypoints for the vehicle to follow.  These waypoints are comprised of an x,y and z position, an orientation for the vehicle to be in (yaw) as well as a velocity target to be achieved.  These base waypoints are published so that the vehicle can make decisions based on it's perceived surroundings.

As arcitected the Obstacle Detection Node receives image data, current position on the map and base waypoints.  It could be set up to detect obstacles, modify the waypoints to change lanes, speed up, slow down or stop in order to avoid these obstacles.  The Traffic Light Detection Node receives image, position and base waypoints as well and a traffic light classifier was implemented in order to react to the detected traffic light state accordingly. Both the Obstacle Detection Node and Traffic Light Detection Node each return a waypoint which represent a modifier that indicates where an obstacle or traffic light is.  The Waypoint Updater Node then takes action on this information.

#### Waypoint Updater Node
The Waypoint Updater Node takes in the base waypoints, current position and a traffic light waypoint.  The obstacle waypoint is not implemented for this project but could be implemented in a similar fashion.
The traffic light waypoint, traffic_waypoint, is broadcast and received as a waypoint at which the vehicle should stop when the Traffic Light Classifier identifies a red light.  If the state of the light is yellow or green the waypoint is set to a value which the vehicle does not consume (-1).  If the state of the light is red, the waypoint is set to a waypoint index in advance of the light to effect a safe stopping position (vehicle bumper on stop line, clear from intersection).  The waypoint speed is set to zero and a function is implemented to create a target speed between the vehicle's current waypoint and the stop waypoint.  This creates a ramp down in speed.  The brake controller is activated and the throttle command goes to zero and the PID is reset when the speed desired is below the actual speed by a target threshold value.  When the vehicle comes to a stop the brake pressure is set to a 700N-m threshold to overcome torque creep of the automatic transmission.  When the light changes state the waypoint stop index is cleared and the vehicle resets the brake PID controller and enables the throttle controller.  The throttle controller then targets a speed which is unmodified from the original base_waypoints signal.

### Perception
#### Obstacle Detection Node
Obstacle detection is outside the scope of this project as there are no obstacles in the form of cars, bicycles, people or other objects in the simulator or real worl parking lot. Rather we use the traffic light coordinates given to us in the yaml files *stop_line_positions* to generate stop line indices where the car will stop when the traffic light is red as determined by the Traffic Light Detection Node.


#### Traffic light Detection Node
The traffic lights are classified into **Red**, **Yellow**, **Green** and **Unknown** by the classifier. The classifier consist of a SSD (Single Shot Detector) network which is borrowed from  [Pierluigi Ferrari: SSD-Keras](https://github.com/pierluigiferrari/ssd_keras) Github. We have used his 7-layer SSD architecture (SSD-7), which is very fast, yet still capable of giving a good classification score on the traffic lights in the simulator and in Carla. Luigi recorded a speed of 127 frames per second using a Geforce GTX 1070 (mid-tear graffic card). 
Originally the classifier outputs 5 classes ('car', 'truck', 'pedestrian', 'bicyclist', 'light'), but we have retrained it to only predict the three traffic light states as well as the 'unknown' which covers when there are no traffic lights. The bounding boxes have also been trained, but are not used during classification. Here only the top score, ie. best prediction is used to get the classification. 

The SSD-7 network weights are retrained using two small datasets of a couple of houndred images from the simulator and from Carla. After training on each datasets the weights were saved, so we have a weight set for the simulator and one for Carla. 
The decision for which weights to use is done using the **yaml** files (*site_traffic_light_config.yaml* or *site_traffic_light_config.yaml*) together with the **is_site** parameter. 
All the relevant Python scripts for training the net work is found [here](/TrainingScript/ssd_keras).
We have used the script [training](/TrainingScript/ssd_keras/ssd7_training.ipynb) for training the network, and [inference](/TrainingScript/ssd_keras/ssd7_inference.ipynb) for testing the network.

Examples of prediction on the simulator and Carla can be seen below:

### Control

## Installation Options

Please use **one** of the two installation options, either native **or** docker installation.

### Native Installation

* Be sure that your workstation is running Ubuntu 16.04 Xenial Xerus or Ubuntu 14.04 Trusty Tahir. [Ubuntu downloads can be found here](https://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop).
* If using a Virtual Machine to install Ubuntu, use the following configuration as minimum:
  * 2 CPU
  * 2 GB system memory
  * 25 GB of free hard drive space

  The Udacity provided virtual machine has ROS and Dataspeed DBW already installed, so you can skip the next two steps if you are using this.

* Follow these instructions to install ROS
  * [ROS Kinetic](http://wiki.ros.org/kinetic/Installation/Ubuntu) if you have Ubuntu 16.04.
  * [ROS Indigo](http://wiki.ros.org/indigo/Installation/Ubuntu) if you have Ubuntu 14.04.
* [Dataspeed DBW](https://bitbucket.org/DataspeedInc/dbw_mkz_ros)
  * Use this option to install the SDK on a workstation that already has ROS installed: [One Line SDK Install (binary)](https://bitbucket.org/DataspeedInc/dbw_mkz_ros/src/81e63fcc335d7b64139d7482017d6a97b405e250/ROS_SETUP.md?fileviewer=file-view-default)
* Download the [Udacity Simulator](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Capstone/releases).
